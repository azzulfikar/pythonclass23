#Both code and the report has been modified using CHATGPT 3.5 for providing an easy read; for report, it was about fixing grammar issues and a more concise structure of the sentence
#and for the code, something due to some mistakes I did in the writing the functions it gave errors, I fixed them by using CHATGPT. 
#However, all content for both report and code belongs to me. Necessary referances were given in the report for literature review and conclusive remarks.
